This is the SageTeX package. It allows you to embed code, results of
computations, and plots from the Sage mathematics software suite
(http://sagemath.org) into LaTeX documents.
====================================================================

To use SageTeX, you need the files sagetex.sty and sagetex.py. If those
haven't been extracted from the .dtx file, you'll need to do:

  0. Run `latex sagetexpackage.ins'

If a PDF file of the documentation wasn't included with this
distribution of SageTex, you will need to build the documentation
yourself. To do that:

  1. Run `latex sagetexpackage.dtx'
  2. Run `sage sagetexpackage.sage'
  3. Run the indexing commands that the .ins file told you about.
  4. Run `latex sagetexpackage.dtx' again.

You can skip step 3 if you don't care about the index. You will need the
pgf and tikz packages installed to typeset the figures.

The file example.tex has, as you likely guessed, a bunch of examples
showing you how this package works. You can compile it using a another
latex-sage-latex cycle as in steps 1-2-4 above. Note that example.tex
includes some PNG graphics which latex cannot use; to see those, use
pdflatex instead of regular latex or enable the imagemagick option. (See
the documentation.)

To use the SageTeX package with your own documents, see the
"Installation" section of the documentation.
