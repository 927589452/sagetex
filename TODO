* should I switch over entirely to the Sweave strategy, where we parse a
  file into LaTeX format?

* hyperlinks in documentation between LaTeX and Python functions that
  are interdependent

* What about graphs and TikZ?

* desagetexparser -- leave Sage commands in as comments? document usage!

* http://groups.google.com/group/sage-devel/browse_thread/thread/f95dfbf6caea17cb/67c77a05bb567940

* UPDATE v2.0 date in .dtx file when it's ready!
