* put Sage calls into a try/except so that we can print line numbers if
  things blow up

* hyperlinks in documentation between LaTeX and Python functions that
  are interdependent

* magic bits written to .sage so we can keep the Python module in the
  same place as the .sty file?

* deal with graphics issues; use PGF? No warnings about missing graphics
  files
